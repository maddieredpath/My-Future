# My Future
_Hopefully_, my future consists of some IT career.  
Because of that, I will share why in python form code!  

```
print('my dad is an IT')
print('I love what I am studying, since I changed my major from business')
```
Also, here's a project: 
``` js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello Infotech 1000!</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Infotech 1000 is Awesome</h1>
<p>I love coding! It is so very fun.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
